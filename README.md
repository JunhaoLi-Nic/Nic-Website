## First set up vite, react, typescript
```bash
npm create vite@latest  
npm i   (To install the packages)
npm i -D @types/node   
```

(This package contains TypeScript definitions for Node.js, which allows you to use Node.js built-in modules with TypeScript. The -D flag is short for --save-dev, which means the package will be saved in your package.json file under the devDependencies section. This is typically used for packages that are only needed during development and not in production.)
