                            At SIL3 Pty Ltd, I have been contributing to the development of a flight control system for AMSL Aero Pty Ltd using the Arcadia methodology. My role involves generating test cases based on specifications, standards, or concepts in C#, ensuring any failing tests are identified and corrected. Additionally, I manage the integration of test cases with Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, making sure that changes in the code base are reflected in the test cases.

                            effectively contributed to the debugging and verification of embedded firmware in C on Texas Instruments RM57 safety CPUs, ensuring robust performance on hardware targets. I also performed comprehensive software verification and validation using Microsoft Visual Studio. Additionally, I undertook development and investigative initiatives on Jetson Nano development hardware, leveraging my skills in Linux, Python, and C# to enhance project outcomes.
